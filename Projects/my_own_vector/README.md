"This project involves defining my own Vector-like data type. The operations that are defined on "Vec" are: 
1) Init empty vec.
2) Init vec with size n.
3) Obtain iterators and size_types.
4) Can use index and size().
5) Get iterators to first and 1 past the end.
Also this project was made with help from Accelerated C++."
