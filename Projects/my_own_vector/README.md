"This program is made from code from Accelerated C++. It is an implementation of the standard library Vector class. Class implements iterator, push_back, size, assignment and indexing operations." 
=======
"This project involves defining my own Vector-like data type. The operations that are defined on "Vec" are: 
1) Init empty vec.
2) Init vec with size n.
3) Obtain iterators and size_types.
4) Can use index and size().
5) Get iterators to first and 1 past the end.

Also this project was made with help from Accelerated C++."
